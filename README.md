Guest Book - there are alot of things getting everything together, it took a while to make everything linked, and then had some issues with getting it on render. But finally deployed and live. Used abit of css to make it look good, i used web3 to add some more elements, using trasform, transition and animation. Really good seeing everything coming together.
